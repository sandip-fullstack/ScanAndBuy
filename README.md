The Problems customer face while shopping in a store

2. Oh Nooo!!! The product is out of stock in shelf. But I want to gift this to my wife tomorrow. Now I have to find it outside.
3. I don’t know how to install the product or what all the build materials for this product. Should I ask the store associate? Does he/she know?
4. Let me check this product online. But typing the long word in dotcom search field and still I get 100 products matched to my search.
